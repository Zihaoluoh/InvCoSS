## Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of **InvCoSS**, a novel inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training.

**Key Features:**
- Continual self-supervised learning for medical imaging
- Inversion-driven approach for knowledge preservation and transfer
- Multi-modal support (CT, MRI, X-ray, etc.)
- Self-supervised pre-training

## Code and Pre-trained Weights

**Code and pre-trained weights will be released upon paper acceptance.**
